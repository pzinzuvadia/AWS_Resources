## Core Concepts

### Instances
An EC2 instance is a virtual server in the AWS cloud. You can launch instances from Amazon Machine Images (AMIs) with various configurations of CPU, memory, storage, and networking capacity.

### Amazon Machine Images (AMIs)
AMIs are templates containing the software configuration (operating system, application server, applications) required to launch an instance.

```bash
# List available AMIs
aws ec2 describe-images --owners amazon --filters "Name=name,Values=amzn2-ami-hvm-*"

# Launch an instance from an AMI
aws ec2 run-instances --image-id ami-0c55b159cbfafe1f0 --instance-type t3.micro --key-name MyKeyPair
```

### Key Pairs
Key pairs are used for secure SSH access to your instances.

```bash
# Create a key pair
aws ec2 create-key-pair --key-name MyKeyPair --query 'KeyMaterial' --output text > MyKeyPair.pem

# Set proper permissions
chmod 400 MyKeyPair.pem
```

## Instance Types

EC2 offers a wide range of instance types optimized for different use cases:

| Family | Types | Optimized For | Use Cases |
|--------|-------|---------------|-----------|
| General Purpose | T3, M5, M6g | Balance of compute, memory, networking | Web servers, small databases |
| Compute Optimized | C5, C6g | High performance processors | Batch processing, scientific modeling, gaming |
| Memory Optimized | R5, R6g, X1 | Fast performance for memory-intensive workloads | In-memory databases, real-time analytics |
| Storage Optimized | D2, I3, H1 | High, sequential read/write access to local storage | Data warehousing, Hadoop |
| Accelerated Computing | P3, P4, G4 | Hardware accelerators, or co-processors | Machine learning, graphics processing |

```bash
# Get details about available instance types
aws ec2 describe-instance-types --filters "Name=current-generation,Values=true"
```

## Storage Options

### Instance Store
Temporary block-level storage that's physically attached to the host computer. Data is lost when the instance stops or terminates.

### Amazon EBS
Persistent block storage volumes that can be attached to EC2 instances.

```bash
# Create an EBS volume
aws ec2 create-volume --availability-zone us-east-1a --size 100 --volume-type gp3

# Attach volume to instance
aws ec2 attach-volume --volume-id vol-1234567890abcdef0 --instance-id i-1234567890abcdef0 --device /dev/sdf
```

### EBS Volume Types

| Volume Type | Description | Use Cases |
|-------------|-------------|-----------|
| gp3 | General purpose SSD | Boot volumes, development environments |
| io2 | Provisioned IOPS SSD | I/O-intensive NoSQL and relational databases |
| st1 | Throughput optimized HDD | Big data, data warehouses, log processing |
| sc1 | Cold HDD | Infrequently accessed data, lowest cost |

### Amazon EFS
Scalable file storage that can be mounted by multiple EC2 instances simultaneously.

## Purchasing Options

### On-Demand Instances
Pay for compute capacity by the second with no long-term commitments.

### Reserved Instances
Purchase instances with a significant discount (up to 72%) compared to On-Demand pricing in exchange for a 1 or 3-year commitment.

| Reserved Instance Type | Payment Option | Discount | Flexibility |
|------------------------|----------------|----------|------------|
| Standard RI | All Upfront | Up to 72% | Limited |
| Standard RI | Partial Upfront | Up to 62% | Limited |
| Standard RI | No Upfront | Up to 43% | Limited |
| Convertible RI | All Upfront | Up to 66% | Can change instance family, OS, tenancy, payment option |

### Spot Instances
Request unused EC2 capacity at steep discounts (up to 90% off On-Demand prices).

```bash
# Request a spot instance
aws ec2 request-spot-instances --spot-price "0.03" --instance-count 1 --type "one-time" --launch-specification file://specification.json
```

### Dedicated Hosts
Physical EC2 servers dedicated for your use.

## Networking Features

### VPC Integration
EC2 instances are launched within a Virtual Private Cloud (VPC), allowing you to:
- Define your network topology
- Create subnets (public and private)
- Configure route tables and gateways

### Security Groups
Virtual firewalls that control inbound and outbound traffic to your instances.

```json
// Example security group configuration
{
  "IpPermissions": [
    {
      "IpProtocol": "tcp",
      "FromPort": 22,
      "ToPort": 22,
      "IpRanges": [{"CidrIp": "203.0.113.0/24"}]
    },
    {
      "IpProtocol": "tcp",
      "FromPort": 80,
      "ToPort": 80,
      "IpRanges": [{"CidrIp": "0.0.0.0/0"}]
    }
  ]
}
```

### Elastic IP Addresses
Static IPv4 addresses designed for dynamic cloud computing.

```bash
# Allocate a new Elastic IP
aws ec2 allocate-address --domain vpc

# Associate Elastic IP with an instance
aws ec2 associate-address --instance-id i-1234567890abcdef0 --allocation-id eipalloc-1234567890abcdef0
```

### Enhanced Networking
Higher packet per second (PPS) performance, lower inter-instance latency, and lower network jitter.

## Management and Monitoring

### Auto Scaling
Automatically adjust the number of EC2 instances in your deployment according to conditions you define.

```yaml
# Example Auto Scaling configuration
AutoScalingGroup:
  MinSize: 1
  MaxSize: 10
  DesiredCapacity: 2
  LaunchTemplate:
    LaunchTemplateId: lt-1234567890abcdef0
    Version: $Latest
  VPCZoneIdentifier:
    - subnet-1234567890abcdef0
    - subnet-0987654321fedcba0
```

### Elastic Load Balancing
Automatically distributes incoming application traffic across multiple targets.

| Load Balancer Type | Protocol Support | Use Case |
|--------------------|------------------|----------|
| Application Load Balancer | HTTP, HTTPS | Web applications |
| Network Load Balancer | TCP, UDP, TLS | Low-latency, high throughput applications |
| Gateway Load Balancer | IP | Third-party virtual appliances |
| Classic Load Balancer | TCP, SSL/TLS, HTTP, HTTPS | Legacy applications |

### Amazon CloudWatch
Monitor EC2 instances, collect and track metrics, and set alarms.

```bash
# Get CPU utilization metrics for an instance
aws cloudwatch get-metric-statistics --namespace AWS/EC2 --metric-name CPUUtilization --dimensions Name=InstanceId,Value=i-1234567890abcdef0 --start-time 2023-01-01T00:00:00Z --end-time 2023-01-02T00:00:00Z --period 3600 --statistics Average
```

## Security Best Practices

1. **Least Privilege Access**
   - Use IAM roles with minimum required permissions
   - Avoid using root user credentials
   - Implement role-based access control

2. **Network Security**
   - Place instances in private subnets when possible
   - Use security groups and NACLs to restrict traffic
   - Enable VPC flow logs for network monitoring

3. **Data Protection**
   - Encrypt EBS volumes and snapshots
   - Encrypt data in transit using TLS
   - Regularly backup important data

4. **System Security**
   - Keep operating systems and applications updated
   - Use IMDSv2 for instance metadata requests
   - Implement regular security assessments

## Cost Optimization

1. **Right Sizing**
   - Choose the appropriate instance size for your workload
   - Use CloudWatch metrics to identify underutilized instances

2. **Purchasing Options**
   - Use Reserved Instances for predictable workloads
   - Use Spot Instances for fault-tolerant, flexible workloads
   - Use Savings Plans for commitment-based discounts

3. **Lifecycle Management**
   - Stop or hibernate instances when not in use
   - Use Auto Scaling to match capacity with demand
   - Set up billing alerts to monitor spending

4. **Storage Optimization**
   - Delete unattached EBS volumes
   - Snapshot and delete rarely used volumes
   - Choose appropriate EBS volume types for your needs

## Common Use Cases

- **Web Applications**: Host websites and web applications
- **Development and Testing**: Create and manage development environments
- **Enterprise Applications**: Run business-critical applications
- **Batch Processing**: Process data in batches
- **High-Performance Computing**: Run complex scientific computations
- **Media Transcoding**: Convert media files from one format to another
- **Gaming**: Host multiplayer game servers
